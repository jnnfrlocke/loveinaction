        <h4 id="lunch">School Lunch Initiative</h4>
        <p>The Wisconsin Rapids School District’s policy on lunches is this: At the high school level, if a student does not have enough money in his/her account, the lunch tray is taken away and the food is thrown in the garbage. At the lower levels, the
            student is given 5 “passes” where they still get hot lunch but after that, they are given a cheese sandwich instead of the normal hot lunch meal. At Love in Action, Inc, we absolutely believe that parents, if they have the ability, should
            certainly be putting money in their students’ accounts. However, we also firmly believe that the student should not be punished or shamed if the parent fails in this regard. Love in Action has been working with the Food Service Department
            in the school district and they have agreed to stop the policy of taking away lunches (at the high school level) and giving the alternative meals (elementary/middle school levels) and give all students the normal hot lunch. They agreed to
            do this because Love in Action, Inc has agreed to pay for student to still get a full hot lunch. In order to do this, Love in Action will need to obtain donations.
